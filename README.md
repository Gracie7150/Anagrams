# Anagrams
An anagaram using back tracking and recursion.
This anagram first takes in a word from the user, and then finds all the possible words given a dictionary provided. Next, the user enters how many 
anagrams they want to appear, and then the anagrams that fit the number will appear on the screen. If not, you press enter, and the possible
combinations of one word will show up on the screen. This means in each array, you can use all the letters to fill in the original phrase.
Recursive backtracking is used in this program.
